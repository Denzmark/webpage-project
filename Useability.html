  <p>the bordentown website was easy enough to use by parents and students to find what they were looking for had a lot of flaws in some areas.
  
  The TSA website was easy to use because of it's buttons that don't leave your screen even when opening a new page making it easy to find stuff.
  
  Usability is a way of checking if the website is easy to use and follows the standards of effveryone else because if a website is putting buttons in obscure places where no one has ever looked for a button for most likely the user will not comeback,<br>
  a websites usability depends on tabs with the right and specified heading to lead the user into the page they want to be in, colors indicating if something is a button by changing color when you hover over it or darkens it's color,not too many tabs keeping it simple generalized indicating other tabs,and the webpage not being in a big clutter.
